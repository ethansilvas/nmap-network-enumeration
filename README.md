## Bypass Security Measures

## Notes 

### Enumeration

enumeration = identify all ways we could attack a target, rather than gaining access to target

vital to understand the services that we look for and the opportunities they provide 

what syntax they use for communication + interaction with different services 

gaining access to target system can be narrowed down to: 
- functions and resources that help us interact with target 
- info that provides us with more important info to access our target

### Introduction to Nmap

Nmap = network mapper
- scan networks 
- id which hosts are available on network using raw packets and services/apps 
- names and versions 
- OS detection and versions 
- scanning for misconfigs in packet filters, firewalls, or IDS

use cases: 
- audit security aspects of networks 
- pen test
- check for misconfigs
- types of possible connections
- response analysis 
- port scanning 
- vuln assessment 

types of scans: 
- host discovery 
- port scanning 
- service enumeration and detection 
- OS detection 
- script interaction

basic syntax: `nmap <scan type> <options> <target>`

default to do -sS 
- syn packet 
- never completes handshake 
- if syn/ack packet returned, then port is open
- RST = closed 
- no packet = filtered 

ex: sudo nmap -sS localhost
