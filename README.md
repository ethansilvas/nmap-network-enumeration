## Notes 

### Enumeration

enumeration = identify all ways we could attack a target
	rather than gaining access to target

vital to understand the services that we look for and the opportunities they provide 
	what syntax they use for communication + interaction with different services 

gaining access to target system can be narrowed down to: 
	* functions and resources that help us interact with target 
	* info that provides us with more important info to access our target
